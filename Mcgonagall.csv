MCGONAGALL,DUMBLEDORE,"This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?"
MCGONAGALL,DUMBLEDORE,Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.
MCGONAGALL,DUMBLEDORE,Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them...
MCGONAGALL,SEVERUS,Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat.
MCGONAGALL,MAD-EYE,Professor Moody what are you doing?
MCGONAGALL,MAD-EYE,Is that a student?
MCGONAGALL,MAD-EYE,"We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that."
MCGONAGALL,MAD-EYE,Well you will do well to remember it.
MCGONAGALL,,"The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance."
MCGONAGALL,,"Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons."
MCGONAGALL,,"(Continued) Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight."
MCGONAGALL,,"Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me."
MCGONAGALL,,"Now, place your right hand on my waist."
MCGONAGALL,RON,My waist.
MCGONAGALL,RON,Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...
MCGONAGALL,RON,"One two three, one two three, one two three."
MCGONAGALL,,Everybody come together.
MCGONAGALL,,"Boys, on your feet."
MCGONAGALL,HARRY,Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
MCGONAGALL,HARRY,To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that.
MCGONAGALL,HARRY,"Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil."
