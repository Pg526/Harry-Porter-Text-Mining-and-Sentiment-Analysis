HERMIONE,HARRY,Harry!
HERMIONE,HARRY,Are you alright?
HERMIONE,HARRY,Just now. You?
HERMIONE,RON,Wake up. Wake up Ronald!
HERMIONE,,"Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready."
HERMIONE,ARTHUR,What??
HERMIONE,HARRY,Harry it's his mark.
HERMIONE,RON,"This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?"
HERMIONE,HARRY,"It's hurting again isn't it, your scar."
HERMIONE,HARRY,"You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream."
HERMIONE,RON,Alastor Moody? The aura.
HERMIONE,MAD-EYE,Three sir.
HERMIONE,MAD-EYE,Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...
HERMIONE,MAD-EYE,"Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!"
HERMIONE,RON,"There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face."
HERMIONE,NEVILLE,Neville?
HERMIONE,TWINS,It's not going to work.
HERMIONE,FRED,You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.
HERMIONE,GEORGE,So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
HERMIONE,HARRY,Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.
HERMIONE,RON,We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?
HERMIONE,HARRY,Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you.
HERMIONE,,Uhhh...
HERMIONE,RON,Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.
HERMIONE,HARRY,I'm NOT an owl!
HERMIONE,HARRY,Pssst! Harry? Is that you?
HERMIONE,HARRY,How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...
HERMIONE,DUMBLEDORE,Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
HERMIONE,HARRY,Your wand harry! Your wand!
HERMIONE,,Boys.
HERMIONE,,(Reading a newspaper) Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
HERMIONE,RON,They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.
HERMIONE,RON,It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
HERMIONE,RON,Oh well spotted.
HERMIONE,RON,I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.
HERMIONE,GIRL,What?
HERMIONE,HARRY,No of course.
HERMIONE,GIRL,She said yes??
HERMIONE,VIKTOR,Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
HERMIONE,RON,What's got your wand in a knot?
HERMIONE,RON,"The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends."
HERMIONE,RON,How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.
HERMIONE,RON,What? What? That's what you think?
HERMIONE,RON,You know the solution then don't you.
HERMIONE,RON,"Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort."
HERMIONE,HARRY,Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you. Harry and Ron walk away.
HERMIONE,RON,Ron you spoil everything!
HERMIONE,HARRY,Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.
HERMIONE,HARRY,"I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?"
HERMIONE,HARRY,"I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time."
HERMIONE,HARRY,"Harry, tell me again."
HERMIONE,HARRY,"The black lake, that's obvious.   "
HERMIONE,HARRY,"Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic"
HERMIONE,HARRY,"Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out."
HERMIONE,MAD-EYE,"But sir, the second task is only hours away and..."
HERMIONE,HARRY,Harry!
HERMIONE,HARRY,Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably.
HERMIONE,HARRY,Next to last.
HERMIONE,VIKTOR,Bye.
HERMIONE,RON,No.
HERMIONE,HARRY,Everything's going to change now isn't it?
HERMIONE,HARRY,Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
HERMIONE,HARRY,Harry will won't you?
